# Color Theory
Players Travel As A Ball Collecting Colors And Changing Colors Based On The Color They Hit And The Color They Are. The objective is to get past all of the barriers by matching the color of the barrier (allowing it to pass through).

### This game was created using the Unity platform and C#.

Based On RYB Color System:
- ğŸŸ¥ + ğŸŸ¨ = ğŸŸ§
- ğŸŸ¨ + ğŸŸ¦ = ğŸŸ©
- ğŸŸ¦ + ğŸŸ¥ = ğŸŸª

Additionally, the ball will stay the same if it goes through an orb with the same color or enters an orb whose color is dependant on the user ball's color. This creates for interesting game play as the player may choose the wrong orb to pass the next barrier.
